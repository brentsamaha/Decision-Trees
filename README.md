# Decision-Trees

In this class assignment, we were tasked with creating multiple models including a decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, and XGBoost model. To run these models, parameters were configurd using grid and random search, depending on the model, to find the optimal parameters. After creating these models, I measured their performance by their corresponding AUC metric. As expected, the XGBoost model performed the best when applied to validation data. Further, using the XGBoost model, I then found which threshold for classification would lead to the highest F1-score as asked in the assignment.
